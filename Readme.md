This project has been created to fulfill the task of a Coursera Qwikilabs assessment "Automate updates to catalog information" as part of "Automating Real-World Tasks with Python" course. (https://www.coursera.org/learn/automating-real-world-tasks-python?specialization=google-it-automation)

The assessment involved writing Python scripts to:

1.  Modify images.
2.  Convert text data to json.
3.  Submit the results to API endpoint.
4.  Generate and send a PDF report by email.
5.  Monitor the health of the machine and send alerts by email.

I plan to update this repository over time as I advance my knowledge.
